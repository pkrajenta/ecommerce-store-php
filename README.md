# ecommerce store
This web app combines PHP for the backend, HTML/CSS for the frontend, and MySQL for the database to create a simple, functional online shopping experience.

### Key features
User Authentication: Seamless registration and login system to keep track of customer accounts.
Product Management: Browse, add, edit, or delete products directly through the browser, with all data stored securely in a MySQL database.
Shopping Cart: Users can easily add items to their basket, review their cart, and adjust quantities before placing an order.
Order Notification: Upon checkout, customers receive an order confirmation via email, powered by PHPmailer integration.

This repository includes a database dump file, shop_db.sql, designed for use with phpMyAdmin. The dump contains 3 essential tables that power the core functionalities of this e-commerce site.
